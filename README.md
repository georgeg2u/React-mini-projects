  # React-mini-projects
This repository contains the course source code of my react mini projects.

  **How to use**
  
The code snapshots are organized in multiple branches where every branch represents a project.
You can switch branches via the branch dropdown above the directory explorer.

**Downloading code snapshots**

You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either clone the repository or simply download the selected branch  content as a ZIP file.

  **Running the attached code**

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.
Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys.
